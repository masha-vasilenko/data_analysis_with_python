# Data Analysis with Python Course

Python for Data Analysis Mini-Course
Course Description
Who might be interested: 
Analysts  working mostly with Excel and SQL and are looking to expand their basic toolset to doing data analysis in Python (e.g., because the data sets they work with no longer fit the spreadsheets ðŸ™‚)
Developers who feel like they want to perform basic data analysis on their own and/or better understand better what data analysts talk about when they present their data analyses.  
Anyone who has some experience with Python and is interested in getting started with data analysis
The course will be data case-driven: weâ€™ll be learning how to analyze a real dataset to answer business-related questions
We will meet once a week (for appx. 60-90 min) over Zoom to learn core concepts and do analysis together. I think weâ€™ll have 4-5 meetings in total
You will have homework ðŸ˜› so that you could get even more practice.  Some lessons will involve skills drilling (like practicing with NumPy arrays and Pandas series) - for those you will get resources and toy data sets to learn and practice. 
For every topic I will provide links to materials, blogs, articles etc - everything that might help you get more practice and better understand things.

### How to approach a dataset and analyze it?

 *Analytical framework (itâ€™s all about asking questions)

- Describe the dataset
- Ask questions about the dataset size (How big is dataset?)
- What types of data Iâ€™m dealing with (organized by time; timestamps, numerical, categorical)
- How much is missing and why
- Categorical: basic stats and basic viz
- Numerical: get basic stats and basic viz
- Data Cleaning and Prep:
- Missing values
- Duplicates etc
- Replacing values
- Transformations (mapping)
- Outliers
- What questions we can answer having this data?
- Metrics
- Relationships
- Data aggregation 
- Pivot tables
- Group by


*Basic data Viz with Matplotlib and Seaborn (and maybe Plotly)
 
*Do we nee more data? 

- Joins, merges and other data wrangling

*Statistics for A/B testing  with Python and A/B testing fundamentals

- Stat. Distributions: drawing from and describing
- Basic stats: sample mean, variation
- Hypothesis testing:
  - Key assumptions
  - Formulating hypotheses
  - Statistical tests
  - Evaluating results (p-value, Confidence intervals)
  - Bootstrap methods*
